# Library Management CLI Application

## Development Approach

### Code Structure

I began the project by implementing key functionalities outlined in `main.py`, focusing on components like `user_manager`, `book_manager`, and `checkout_manager`. To ensure clarity and maintainability, I carefully organized the code into distinct folders, facilitating a clear separation of concerns.

In response to the challenge of distinguishing between models and manager methods, I opted for a structured approach. This involved categorizing files into purposeful folders such as:
- `apps`
- `db`
- `logger`
- `models`
- `settings`
- `utils`

# Library Management CLI Application Folder Structure

## `apps`

This folder houses the main executable files and serves as the entry point to the application. It encapsulates the core logic and orchestrates the interactions between different modules.

## `db`

The `db` folder is designated for handling data storage and retrieval. It manages the persistence of application data, ensuring that user and book information is stored reliably and can be retrieved across application sessions.

## `logger`

In the `logger` folder, you'll find utilities for logging operations within the application. Logging is essential for tracking and recording various events, providing insights into the application's behavior and aiding in debugging.

## `models`

The `models` folder contains the data models representing key entities in the application, such as users and books. Each model defines the structure and behavior of its corresponding entity, facilitating a clear and organized representation of data.

## `settings`

Configuration settings for the application are stored in the `settings` folder. This includes any constants, configurations, or environment-specific variables that the application relies on.

## `utils`

The `utils` folder houses utility functions and helper modules used across the application. These utilities provide reusable pieces of code that contribute to the efficiency and maintainability of the overall codebase.

## `cli.py` and `main.py`

These files, located in the root directory, serve as the entry points for the command-line interface (CLI) application. `cli.py` may contain functions related to user input and display, while `main.py` orchestrates the overall application flow.

This organizational strategy not only enhances code readability but also positions the project for scalable growth.
